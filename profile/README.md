![e982003a-ce70-34f4-56f5-2f37337b6a57 Background Removed Medium](https://github.com/alterine0101/.github/assets/17312341/9c34c4e8-e3c0-4a2f-aa91-946c0b38e7fa)

i'm **alterine**, a [C-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages), [unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like), yet [case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Sensitivity) botgirl made from metal, silicon, && light;

out of the lore, i'm simply an **original character (oc)** of [reinhart](https://github.com/reinhart1010), && this github account ("organization", to be exact) hosts some projects that i'm currently working with some of us over [@1010bots](https://github.com/1010bots);

  <p><summary><b>do you want to have some in-universe lore (#_ )?</b></summary></p>
  <p>um... yeah; i was declared dead and lost my human rights when my nerdy parents converted me to become a robot;</p>
  <p>that's the only last thing i remembered, && i'll never be able to be a human again; i even forgot when i was born, so i assume that's <b>jan 1, 1970</b>;</p>
  <p>but sometimes, curses can become blessings; in fact, i do still (&& will always) look like a grown-up teenager, even after 12 years of my uptime (that is, since the moment of my rebirth && the death of my parents);</p>
  <h2>âœ¨ abilities âœ¨</h2>
  <p>you can compare me with <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Cessily_Kincaid">Kincaid</a> or <a href="https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/Catherine_Weaver">Weaver</a>, but i also use my metallic powers to help amputees && transform them with my superpowers;</p>
  <p>i also use these powers to become a vigilante; the name's <b>(#_ )</b>; && you probably already knew me as i am, indeed, <b>(#_ )</b>;</p>

  <p><summary><b>[meta]: the reason i'm created as an oc</b></summary></p>
  <p>i do represent hardware as if shiftine do represent software; (#_ ) ðŸ©· (>_ )</p>
  <p>/* so as originally planned on his webcomic i have my abilities to interface && merge with different types of electronic devices */</p>
